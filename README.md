# UAERealEstateReccomendation
Used a public data set about UAE real estate in 2024 


**prev_house_filtering.py**
This script processes previously owned properties and uses Euclidean distance to recommend the 5 most similar houses based on features like price, size, bedrooms, bathrooms, and address similarity (using TF-IDF). It supports recommendations for individual houses or averaged data from multiple properties owned by a client.


**most_successful.py**
this script groups the projects together and finds which ones are most profitable, then displays the top 5. Generalized costs since I do not have access to them.
